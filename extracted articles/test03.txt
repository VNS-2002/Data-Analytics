Title: 22 Life Lessons I Learned From My Mentors That Every Person Should Know - Darius Foroux

With every conversation I have, a book I read, a mistake I make, and new knowledge I acquire, I feel less sure about everything.
The French philosopher Voltaire said it best:
“The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.”
When I got my first degree in business, nine years ago, I was certain I knew nothing. So I got a master’s degree after that. That took me about two more years.
Still, I knew nothing. So after that, I did my best to learn from mentors, family, business partners, clients, friends, colleagues. I tried to absorb all their knowledge.
I’ve been blessed to meet a lot of wonderful people from who I’ve learned a lot from. And if you also want to learn from people you look up to, just observe them. Understand how they behave, think, talk, work, conduct business, etc.
That’s why I think everyone has mentors. But not everyone actively observes them.
Most of us expect a mentor to show up and say:
“As of today, I’m your official mentor. Here‘s lesson one: Don’t be an idiot.”
I don’t know about you, but that has never happened to me. Instead, I find ways to spend time with people I want to learn from and learn by observing them. That strategy has helped me a lot in recent years.
Here’s a list of things I’ve observed my mentors saying. I hope you find it useful too.
What new thing did you learn today? After writing this list, I learned that all the stuff I know, I’ve learned from others. Does that make me stupid? I don’t give a shit anyway. It’s time to rest.
